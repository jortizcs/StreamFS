/**
 * The <code>Cursor</code> object is used to acquire bytes from a 
 * given source. This provides a cursor style reading of bytes from 
 * a stream in that it will allow the reader to move the cursor back
 * if the amount of bytes read is too much. Allowing the cursor to 
 * move ensures that excess bytes back be placed back in the stream.
 * <p>
 * This is used when parsing input from a stream as it ensures that
 * on arrival at a terminal token any excess bytes can be placed 
 * back in to the stream. This allows data to be read efficiently
 * in large chunks from blocking streams such as sockets.
