== Integrated Sensor Stream Storage System (IS4) v2.0 ==
Author:  Jorge Ortiz (jortiz@cs.berkeley.edu)
Date: January 01,2011

IS4 is a storage system for sensor data streams.  IS4 uses multiple persistence layers and each must be
installed and set up for IS4 to function properly.  MySQL is used to manage the IS4 resources accessible 
as IS4 URIs.  The MongoDB storage layer is used as the main publisher-data repository.

===============================
===== Strict Dependencies  ====
===============================
-  Java 1.6 SE
-  MySQL
-  MongoDB

===============================
== Installation Instructions ==
===============================

1.  Type 'source tools/build/is4Setup.sh'
2.  Type 'source tools/build/build_all.sh'
3.  Type 'chmod 777 tools/build/make_.sh; tools/build/make_.sh'
4.  Type 'chmod 777 tools/build/is4daemon.sh'
5.  Create a database in MySql and update $IS4HOME/lib/local/db/db_config/db_info.json to point to your mysql server
6.  Update $IS4HOME/lib/local/db/db_config/db_archive_info.json to point to the address where mongodb server is hosted,
	you can also add a "port" attribute with the port of the mongodb instance for times when it's not on the default
	27017 port.
7.  Type 'mysql -u <username> -p -h localhost <dbname> < $IS4HOME/lib/local/db/db_tables/is4LocalTables.sql'
8.  Type 'mysql -u <username> -p -h <mysqlserver> <dbname> < $IS4HOME/lib/local/db/db_tables/is4_remote_repos.sql
9.  Type 'is4daemon.sh &'

Step 8 may also be set up on your local server.  Most of the tables that are made by 'is4_remote_repos.sql' are for storage and are not used.  Since this is the first release it has not yet been removed.

The last steps sets up is4 as a background process.  If you want to want to run it in the foreground with output
just run './runis4'.  You can also change the logging by changing the symbolic link logger.config to point
to logger.config.verbose or logger.config.verbosefile.

By default IS4 binds to localhost:8080.  If you want to change this, change the IS4_HOSTNAME and IS4_PORT in tools/build/is4Setup.sh.  After changing it type 'tools/build/is4Setup.sh' and 'tools/build/make_.sh', then either step 9 or ./runis4.

===============================
=== Optional Dependencies  ====
===============================
-  Apache2 or WebServer + PHP

1.  Type 'mysqldump -u <username> -p -h localhost <dbname> < $IS4HOME/lib/local/db/db_tables/is4Buffer.sql'

Step 7 is optional.  If you want to create a visualization component that is poll-only, step 7 may be followed
and you may have your web server point to apps/buffer.php.
